# Cyber_Security_Brute_Force_Timing_AES_DES_3DES
Brute force algorithm for attempting maximum speed of decryptions in AES (256-bits), DES (56-bits) and 3-DES (168-bits) systems.
It's important to point out, that this program is not intended for the decryption of AES, DES and 3-DES systems.
This is due to the fact that attempting to break one of those systems by brute force in a normal computer, would take too much time.
Therefore, the limit of attempts for decryption are 200,000 times.
You may download the program and change the limits, for trying to break AES, DES or 3-DES, if you have available a more powerful computer.
The main goal of this program, is to test the speed of decryptions that can be performed, for any of this algorithms.
The program is implemented in JAVA.
